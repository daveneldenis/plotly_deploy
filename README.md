Background
Complete dashboard panel for demographic information in order to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically,volunteers for the study should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in quantity in their navel.

Objectives
Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
Complete the demographic information panel.
Deploy the app to a free static page hosting service. GitHub Pages. Then, submit the link to the webpage (deployment) as well as a link to the GitHub repository by pasting both links in the text box.
